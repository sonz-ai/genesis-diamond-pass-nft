 * @title EOARegistryAccess
 * @author Limit Break, Inc.
 * @notice A contract mixin that provides access to an external EOA registry.
 * For use when a contract needs the ability to check if an address is a verified EOA.
 * @dev Take care and carefully consider whether or not to use this. Restricting operations to EOA only accounts can break Defi composability, 
 * so if Defi composability is an objective, this is not a good option.  Be advised that in the future, EOA accounts might not be a thing
 * but this is yet to be determined.  See https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337 for more information.
